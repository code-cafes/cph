# Code Cafés

This repo is related to the meetup group [CoDe Cafés](https://www.meetup.com/code-cafes)

>**"CoDe" as in Continuous Delivery**
>A CoDe Café is like a hackathorn, but with a preorganized sprint log, focusing on creating value, sharing it with the world as Open Source.
>
>Cafés are 3-8 hours, each café has a specific theme or challenge, but always with the concept of Continuous Delivery as the foundation.
>
>The focus is on Serverless, programmable & immutable
>
>We collaborate around a pre-shared backlog, grooming it, using a Kanban approach, into a workable sprint log using a broad stack of tools for a collaboration backend, as if we were a distributed team.

It's even related to a [specfic Meetup - held in Allerød, Denmark on Wednesday June 20th 2018](https://www.meetup.com/code-cafes/events/251508242/)



It's really [the issues in this repo](https://github.com/code-cafes/cph/issues/) (see them in [Waffle](https://waffle.io/code-cafes/cph)), that is the driver for everything.
