# CoDe Cafés

**This repo is related to the CoDe Café [events organized by Prolike](https://www.prolike.io/events)**

## "CoDe" as in Continuous Delivery**
>A CoDe Café is like a hackathorn, but with a preorganized kanban project plan, focusing on creating value, sharing it with the world as Open Source.
>
>Cafés are 3-8 hours, each café has one or more specific theme or challenge, defined as _Epics_ and typically with the concept of Continuous Delivery as the foundation.
>
>The focus is on Serverless, programmable & immutable infrastructure and technologies that supports it.
>
>We collaborate around a pre-shared backlog, grooming it, using a Kanban approach, into a workable issues that are prioritized, estimated and well-desc ribed. We use a broad stack of tools for a collaboration backend, as if we were a distributed team.

## Plan the work - work the plan
It's really [the issues in this repo](https://github.com/code-cafes/cph/issues/) that are the driver for everything.

You should do yourself the favor and browse the issues from [the ZenHub board](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/code-cafs-5e6b3247567b4e5a45ea6d56/board?repos=136432576) it requires that you authorized the app with your GitHub account - we strongly encourage you do do that, since our process utilized a handful of neat features, that ZenHub build on top of GitHub.

## Somtimes the hackathons are virtual
In times of the Corone pandemic we don't meet on an actual geopoint, but instead we organized distributed work.

The process is almost the same, only no joint lunch and chit-chats across the room are replaced with Google hangouts.

## The typical program for a CoDe Café


### Prep and signup
* Each announced café has is own dedicated "welcome" issue. You should typically find it as an issue in the repo that [`is:open` and has `label:welcome`](https://github.com/code-cafes/cph/labels/welcome).
* To let attend the Café you should simply go and write some kind af salute og greating to the team on the welcome issue. This way we'll know your GitHub handle and we will add you to the team in the [CoDe Cafés organization](https://github.com/code-cafes) on GitHub.
* Read the issue and comment on the ones you find interesting - or just think that you can contribute. Suggest new ones if you have something you'd like to work with.
*  Assign youself to all the issues that you intend to work on - you are welcom to assign yourself to more than one.

### TGICC
> _"Thank God It's CoDe Café"_

* Finally that day arrives. CoDe Cafés typically start at 10:00.
* If we meet in real life _AWFK_ then we'll start with some mingle, breakfast and lots of coffee. If it's an all digital event, or if someone is joining from a distributed location we will fire up a google meet session this meet will be reused several times during the day for orgniazing the café and presenting the work.
* We will go through the issues on the ZenHub board and try to organize the day - much of it will probably be self-organized, since hopefully there has been a lively chat and commenting on the issues leading up to TGICC.
* We will spread out in smaller groups, organized around _epics_, each epic can have several issues in it and peple can work them together, as a team.
* If we are not meeting in real life, then each _Epic_ will be set up with it's own googl meet.

### Hacke-di-hack-commit-present
* Each _epic_ team will work self-organized for about two hours.
* During this time everyone will strive to create tanglible results. These results will have to be persisted, as we go. It's an important part the distributed nature of how we work. It has the benefit, that everyon has a chance to get into the details of what another epic team worked with - So persist the work:
  * _either_ as commits in git, that are committed to `master` and pushed to `origin`.
  * _or_ as thorough updates, uploads, comments on the relevant GitHub issues.
* After each session we will all gather - if it's a digital event we'll meet in the same google meet as we used to kick off the day - to get brief updates from each group on their echievements and findings.

### Time for lunch
We serve a lunch, if it's and _AWFK_ event, and if not, then people get a chance to grab a bite for themeselves.

### Kaizen blitz
Right after lunch, we will run a short kaizen blitz. Kaizen means _good change_ and is the core af a _small steps manifesto_ What small changes could be done, to improve the process.

### Reorganize-repeat
We usually run two cycles, so after lunch, we will simply kick of another round of hacke-di-hack-commits. People can stick to the same epic teams or form new ones.

### Hi' five - See yah!
The day officially ends with a another kaizen blitz, a high five and a _"see yah!"_

### Drink Up
If it's a real-life _AWFK_ it's quite common to go out after the Café to grab a beer and an inexpensive bar-meal. So set aside some time to join that too!
